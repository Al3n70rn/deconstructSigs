deconstructSigs aims to determine the contribution of known mutational processes to a tumor sample. By using deconstructSigs, one can:

* Determine the weights of each mutational signature contributing to an individual tumor sample

* Plot the recreated mutational profile (using the calculated weights) and compare to the original
